## Evaluation Metrics

```
Accuracy = no. predicted correctly / total no. of observation

```
```
Precision= no. predicted as spam that are actually spam / total no. of prediction as spam
```
For False positive optimize model on Precision
```
Recall=no. predicted as spam that are actually spam / total no. of spam
```
For False Negatives optimize model on Recall
