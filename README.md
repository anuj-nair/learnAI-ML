## Evaluation Metrics

```
Accuracy = total no. of correct predictions / total no. of observation
```

#### How many selected items are relevant?
```
Precision = total no. of correct predictions / total no. of prediction
```
For False positive optimize model on Precision

#### How many relevant items are selected?
```
Recall = total no. of correct predictions / total of observation that were supposed to be predicted
```
For False Negatives optimize model on Recall
