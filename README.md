## Evaluation Metrics

```
Accuracy = total no. of correct predictions / total no. of observation
```
```
Precision = total no. of correct predictions / total no. of prediction
```
For False positive optimize model on Precision
```
Recall = total no. of correct predictions / total of observation that were supposed to be predicted
```
For False Negatives optimize model on Recall
